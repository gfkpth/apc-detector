# APC detector demo

*This repo is currently incomplete work in progress as I refactor [bert-apc-trainer](https://github.com/gfkpth/bert-apc-trainer), which was previously hosted as `apc-detector`, and move relevant parts from a prior implementation here.*

This repo contains a small application illustrating the use of the fine-tuned BERT models described/generated in [bert-apc-trainer](https://github.com/gfkpth/bert-apc-trainer).
